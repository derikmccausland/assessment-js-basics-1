//////////////////PROBLEM 2////////////////////
/*
    Create a variable for each of the above steps of the Software Development Lifecycle and set the values of each variable to a definition of the step.

const planning = "This is the first step, in which the end goal of the software is determined and defined. Developers typically will see what systems are already in place, and determine what features will need to be added." 
const analysisOfRequirements = "This is the second step, were you will determine the requirements of the software you are designing"
const design = "This is the third step, where you will begin design what you will be doing in order to complete the project, as in which code language, how the UI will work, and so on."
const implementation = "This is the fourth step, in which the actual prgramming takes place."
const testing = "This is the fifth step, where you will run multiple tests and get the product ready for shipping."
const maintain = "This is the sixth step, where you will maintain your product after pushing it out to the consumer"
